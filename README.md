# Super Store SQL code
SQL code to query the Super Store table as found on Tableau

The link to the table can be found below,
https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/sample_-_superstore.xls

This table for some reason can't be imported at once into Postgresql, so what I did was to break the table into 5 sub tables with a common column RowID
hence the reason why I combined 5 tables in the script
